### 👋 Hey, I'm Enric Trillo!
I'm a recent bachelors graduate, currently based in London, UK. I enjoy using my knowledge and skills in modern technologies to solve problems and materialise ideas. Some of the technologies I enjoy working with include React and GraphQL.
Since I finished university, I started exploring new technologies beyond of what we were taught in lectures. I started by learning a bit of VueJs (but I haven't touched it in a while), then I moved on to learning React. After getting comfortable with React, I started exploring the backend side of things by getting more used to Node and Express, and currently GraphQL. I'm enjoying GQL and I've been developing a few projects to get used to doing things all these technologies combined.
