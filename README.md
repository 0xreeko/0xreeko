### 👋 Hey, I'm Enric Trillo!
I'm a recent bachelors graduate, currently based in London, UK. I enjoy using my knowledge and skills of modern technologies to solve problems and materialise ideas.
I started this tech journey from my early teens, initially by personally learning graphic design and learning a bit of HTML, CSS and JS in school and college.

### 🌱 What I'm currently focusing on
Since I finished university, I started exploring new technologies beyond of what we were taught in lectures. So far, I've learnt a bit of Vue.Js (but I haven't touched it in a while), then I moved on to learning React. After getting comfortable with React, I started exploring the backend side of things by getting more used to Node and Express, and currently GraphQL. I'm enjoying GQL and I've been developing a few mini projects to get used to doing things.
